## About Me

I'm a .NET Developer with a passion for gamedev. I specialize in backend development, but I'm broadening my skillset by learning UI frameworks and TS React for frontend.

I enjoy constantly improving my projects and inventing new and innovative solutions to problems I face.

As games are my passion, I would like to create one using the latest Unity technologies (ECS & DOTS).

## Current Projects
- **ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ [BanchoNET](https://github.com/NovemoG/BanchoNET)**: An [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/) bancho server implementation with W.I.P beatmap server for custom beatmaps upload. The main goal of this project is to provide a simple way to set up and host a third-party server for the game.
  
- **ðŸŒŸ [TuneIn](https://github.com/NovemoG/TuneIn)**: A self-hosted video sharing solution for home usage or small communities. I aim to create a straightforward way for people to share videos (and maybe other things) between each other with a minimalistic web UI that will help them explore and organize their content.
  
- **ðŸŒŸ [YTXpress](https://github.com/Cossinus/YouTubeDownloaderGUI)**: Main focus of this project is to simplify usage of [yt-dlp's](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [ffmpeg's](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) CLI by providing smooth GUI experience with extensive error handling.
